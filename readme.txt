Shipping delivery time estimates for WooCommerce shipping zones, methods, and classes.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**Adding shipping details to your Schema Product markup is important if you offer free or low-cost shipping options, as this will make your products more appealing in Google search results.**

**The WPSSO Shipping Delivery Time for WooCommerce SEO (WCSDT) add-on integrates and extends the *WooCommerce &gt; Settings &gt; Shipping* page with additional shipping delivery times:**

* Choose to show handling and packaging times in the cart and checkout pages.
* Choose to show transit times in the cart and checkout pages.
* Select shipping department hours (cutoff time for new orders and business hours).
* Select min / max handling times for WooCommerce shipping classes.
* Select min / max transit times for WooCommerce shipping zones and methods.
* Increment handling and transit times in half-hours and/or half-days.

The WPSSO WCSDT add-on provides this additional shipping information to the [WPSSO Core plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/) for complete Schema **shippingDetails**, **OfferShippingDetails**, and **ShippingDeliveryTime** markup.
